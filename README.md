# IBull

# Project Overview
IBull is a stock viewer that charts out your stock that you want to see with necessary information of the stock such as PE ratios, beta, etc. We can also save the stocks that we want to our personal watchlist and we can also delete it if we are not interested in that particular stock anymore. Our profile can be CRUDed so we can amend anything we like about ourselves at any point of time. To ensure that our profile is save, we have a login/authentication function that protects access to our information with a JWT token that expires after a while when our login session is too long.
